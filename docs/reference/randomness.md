This page will present you all the functions that can be used to introduce some randomness in your musical patterns. Each function will be presented following the same model:
* **Type signature**: how the function is declared on the **Haskell** side.
* **Description**: verbal description of the function.
* **Examples**: a small list of examples that you can copy/paste in your editor.

## Pseudo-randomisation
### rand

```haskell
Type: rand :: Fractional a => Pattern a
```

`rand` is an oscillator that generates a pattern of (pseudo-)random, floating point numbers between `0.0` and `1.0`. For example to randomly pan around the stereo field you can:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd*8" # pan rand
```
Or to enjoy a randomised speed from `0.5` to `1.5`, you can add `0.5` to it.

```haskell
d1 $ sound "arpy*4" # speed (rand + 0.5)
```

### irand
```haskell
Type: irand :: Num a => Int -> Pattern a
```

`irand` is similar to `rand`, but generates a continuous oscillator of (pseudo-)random integers between `0` to `n-1` inclusive. Notably used to pick random samples from a folder.

```haskell
d1 $ sound "amencutup*8" # n (irand 8)
```

## Perlin noise
### perlin

```haskell
Type: perlin :: Pattern Double
```

`perlin` produces 1D Perlin (smooth) noise. It works like rand but smoothly moves between random values each cycle. For example, you can smoothly and randomly change speed:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd*32" # speed (perlin + 0.5)
```

The `perlin` function produces a new random value to move to every cycle. If you want a new random value to be generated more or less frequently, you can use `fast` or `slow`, respectively:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd*32" # speed (fast 4 $ perlin + 0.5)
d1 $ sound "bd*32" # speed (slow 4 $ perlin + 0.5)
```

### perlinWith

`perlinWith` allows you to specify a pattern as input to generate random values instead of using the default cycle count:

```haskell
d1 $ s "arpy*32" # cutoff (perlinWith (saw * 4) * 2000)
```

### perlin2

`perlin2` creates 2D noise by allowing you to specify a custom pattern as a second dimension (cycle number remains as the first dimension):

```haskell
d1 $ s "bd*32" # speed (perlin2 (sine*4) + 1)
```

### perlin2With

`perlin2With` is the same as `perlinWith` except allows you to provide two functions for 2D noise:

```haskell
d1
 $ s "[arpy*32]"
 # lpf (range 60 5000 $ perlin2With (cosine*2) (sine*2))
 # lpq 0.3
```

## The "sometimes" family

### sometimes

```haskell
Type: sometimes :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
```

`sometimes` is function, that applies another function to a pattern, around 50% of the time, at random. It takes two inputs, the function to be applied, and the pattern you are applying it to.

For example to distort half the events in a pattern:
```haskell
d1 $ sometimes (# crush 2) $ n "0 1 [~ 2] 3" # sound "arpy"
```

`sometimes` has a number of variants, which apply the function with different likelihood: 

| function     | Â likelihood |
|--------------|-------------|
| always       | 100%        |
| almostAlways | 90%         |
| often        | 75%         |
| sometimes    | 50%         |
| rarely       | 25%         |
| almostNever  | 10%         |
| never        | 0%          |


### sometimesBy

If you want to be specific, you can use `sometimesBy` and a number, for example:
```haskell
sometimesBy 0.93 (# speed 2)
```

to apply the speed control on average 93 times out of a hundred.


### someCycles

`someCycles` is similar to `sometimes`, but instead of applying the given function to random events, it applies it to random cycles. For example the following will either distort all of the events in a cycle, or none of them:

```haskell
d1 $ someCycles (# crush 2) $ n "0 1 [~ 2] 3" # sound "arpy"
```

### someCyclesBy

As with `sometimesBy`, if you want to be specific, you can use `someCyclesBy` and a number. For example:

```haskell
someCyclesBy 0.93 (# speed 2)
```

will apply the speed control on average `93` cycles out of a hundred.

## Choosing randomly

### choose
```haskell
Type: choose :: [a] -> Pattern a
```
The `choose` function emits a stream of randomly choosen values from the given list, as a continuous pattern:
```haskell
d1 $ sound "drum ~ drum drum" # n (choose [0,2,3])
```

As with all continuous patterns, you have to be careful to give them structure; in this case choose gives you an infinitely detailed stream of random choices. 

### chooseby

```haskell
Type: chooseBy :: Pattern Double -> [a] -> Pattern a
```
The `chooseBy` function is like choose but instead of selecting elements of the list randomly, it uses the given pattern to select elements.
```haskell
chooseBy "0 0.25 0.5" ["a","b","c","d"]
```
will result in the pattern `"a b c" `.

### wchoose

```haskell
Type: wchoose :: [(a, Double)] -> Pattern a
```

`wchoose` is similar to `choose`, but allows you to 'weight' the choices, so some are more likely to be chosen than others. The following is similar to the previous example, but the `2` is twice as likely to be chosen than the `0` or `3`.

```haskell
d1 $ sound "drum ~ drum drum" # n (wchoose [(0,0.25),(2,0.5),(3,0.25)])
```
:::caution
Prior to version `1.0.0` of **Tidal**, the weights had to add up to `1`, but this is no longer the case. 
:::

### wchooseby

```haskell
Type: wchooseBy :: Pattern Double -> [(a,Double)] -> Pattern a
```

The `wchooseBy` function is like `wchoose` but instead of selecting elements of the list randomly, it uses the given pattern to select elements. 

### cycleChoose

```haskell
Type: cycleChoose :: [a] -> Pattern a
```

Similar to `choose`, but only picks once per cycle:
```haskell
d1 $ sound "drum ~ drum drum" # n (cycleChoose [0,2,3])
```
