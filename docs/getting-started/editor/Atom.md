**UPDATE - Jan 1, 2023:** The Atom Editor has sunset, see the official [Sunsetting Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)
page. Tidal has adopted [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/). Tidalcycles is integrated with the Pulsar Package Manager, which supports installation and updating the tidal plugin from within Pulsar. (There is no longer a need for manual plugin install.) 

See the documentation on [how to use Tidal with Pulsar](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/editor/Pulsar/).

*Note:* Tidal users who have a working Atom editor configured with the Tidalcycles package can continue to use it. *However, the Atom package manager is no longer available to install or update the Tidal package and no further updates to Atom will be available.* Tidal users are encouraged to migrate to Pulsar.

If you still have a requirement to use Atom:

- [Atom GitHub](https://github.com/atom/atom)
- [Atom Final Release - download](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.63.1)
- For the Tidalcycles package:
    - do a manual install
    - use the instructions on the [Pulsar page](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/editor/Pulsar/)
    - substitute `~/.atom/` for `~/.pulsar` so that the package installs to Atom and not Pulsar
