**UPDATE Dec 15:** The Atom Editor has sunset, see the official [Sunsetting Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)
page for more details. Tidal is adopting the new [Pulsar editor](https://pulsar-edit.dev/). The projected timeline to have Pulsar ready with the Tidalcycles package is the end of 2022. Until then, new Tidal users can use Pulsar and install the Tidal package manually or select one of the other editors. See the documentation on [how to use Tidal with Pulsar](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/editor/Pulsar/).

Note: Tidal users who have a working Atom editor configured with the Tidalcycles package can continue to use it. But the Atom package manager is no longer available to install or update the Tidal package and no further updates to Atom will be available. Tidal users are encouraged to migrate to Pulsar.

If you have a requirement to use Atom:

- [Atom GitHub](https://github.com/atom/atom)
- [Atom Final Release - download](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.63.1)
- For the Tidalcycles package
    - Do a manual install with use the instructions on the [Pulsar page](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/editor/Pulsar/)
    - substitute `~/.atom/` for `~/.pulsar` so that the package installs to Atom and not Pulsar
