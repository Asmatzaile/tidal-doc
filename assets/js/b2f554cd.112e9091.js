What have you worked on?**\\n\\nI think I\'ve had a go at just about everything:\\n\\n- I developed and maintain a [Linux installer](https://github.com/cleary/ansible-tidalcycles) in Ansible\\n- I\'ve added a few [simple patches to](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/commits?author=cleary)/nutted out ideas for tidal itself, particularly around the [chords module](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/rfc-working-on-making-chord-naming-chordlist-more-consistent/2717)\\n- I\'ve written [documentation](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/commits?author=cleary)\\n- I often [play in](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjdg8PPpRgsw4w9bSmX5JY7b), and have helped organise some of the Solstice Marathon Livestreams\\n- I am active and support others on the [forums](https://club.tidalcycles.org/u/cleary/summary) and the discord support channels\\n- For the last 2 years I\'ve been hosting a weekly collaborative (mostly tidal) livecoding session called [WeekendJam](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjfCNVBK2O0W0_nwiSgWIoFR) for anyone to come along and have a jam with me\\n- I\'ve written and run tidal-based [workshops](https://decoded.livecode.au), online and [in](https://allevents.in/griffith/decoded-%E2%80%94%E2%80%94-an-artistic-livecoding-workshop/200022125384118) [person](https://infrequency.au/) to try and network/raise the profile of the [livecoding scene in Australia](http://www.ozchi.org/2022/creativity.html)\\n\\n**What motivates you to be a Tidal contributor?**\\n\\n- The community is lovely, they give/have given me a lot and I like to return that where I can. The project allows for such vast and varied possibilities in learning and creation, and that\'s what keeps me interested. The focus on inclusivity, sharing and generally \\"anti-gatekeeping\\" is a huge drawcard for me too.\\n- I particularly enjoy the WeekendJams - I get to meet new people, share inspirations with all the different ideas all mashed together, learn, and just generally have a great time. I\'ve made some great friends through jams.\\n\\n## Livecoding\\n<img src=\\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-7r8LGsw/0/O/i-7r8LGsw.jpg\\"  width=\\"600\\" height=\\"450\\" />   \\n(photo: Jason Richardson)\\n\\n**What do you like about livecoding in Tidal?**\\n\\n- It\'s concise, it\'s (fairly) self-explanatory, and it\'s very easy to be both creatively specific and random as required.\\n\\n**How do you approach your livecoding sessions?**\\n\\n- For solo performances, I prepare something - usually a \\"scaffolded\\" set of code which allows for creative path choosing during the set.\\n- For the WeekendJam sessions, I never prepare anything beyond the occasional group idea for exploration (which is broached 5 mins before start time).\\n\\n**What functions and coding approaches do you like to use?**\\n\\n- I tend to make a point to separate my rhythmic and harmonic elements for easy reuse (`struct` and `n`/`note`) - which is a hangover from the collaborative nature of the WeekendJam sessions. I keep the code for most sets I play on [Github](https://github.com/cleary/livecode/tree/main/sets).\\n\\n**Do you use Tidal with other tools / environments?**\\n\\n- I\'ve done some external software synth control (Vital/Yoshimi), I also have a Midi Fighter Twister controller which sometimes gets a run. I tend to keep it pretty vanilla though, particularly since doing the workshop tours last year. Also, [estuary](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca) of course.\\n\\n## Music\\n**Tell us about your livecoding music. What musical genre(s) or style(s) describe it best?**\\n\\n- Varied? I don\'t really know much about genres - for more musical stuff, I tend to make use of western music theory. If I\'m doing solely rhythmic stuff I tend to try and push myself [outside my common use 4/4 6/8 time signatures](https://youtu.be/to1_4id_oyc) - the few patterns I did for [#patternuary this year](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjdh9SJqIQeku8u9g1acI5Y5) probably highlight that variety fairly well.\\n\\n**How has your music evolved since you have been livecoding?**\\n\\n- Yeah, _a lot_ - I played \\"traditional\\" instruments before I started. The biggest evolution has involved trying to break out of all the subconscious composer lockin that comes with that (fixed tempos, chords limited by number of fingers/how far they can stretch, increasing the number of simultaneous voices). It\'s moved from what I could do on a guitar/bass/piano with 10 fingers and a looper to beyond orchestral possibilities (and exposed my lack of compositional knowledge in that area!).\\n\\n**What samples or instruments do you like to work with?**\\n\\n- Anything :) I\'ve been trying to get more comfortable [working with break samples](https://youtu.be/JsZPN3yqu2s) a bit lately.\\n\\n**What projects are you currently working on / planning? What\'s next?**\\n\\n- I\'d like to develop the livecode.au domain into a tool for organisation/promotion of Australian livecoding events/personalities, that one is going to take more time than I currently have available, so it\'s on the backburner for now (unless anyone wants to give me hand!)\\n- To try and claw back a little time, I\'m looking at sharing the WeekendJam load a little, and hopefully moving it into a general stream/yt account so that multiple organisers can have control depending on availability.\\n- I\'d also like to finish and release some music, just to learn a bit more about the whole process chain - that\'s a hope item for this year :)\\n\\n## Links to your music / recorded livecoding sessions:\\n\\n- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@clearyss\\n- Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/bergra\\n- Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/clearyss\\n- Github (code): https://github.com/cleary/livecode\\n\\n## Other\\n\\nJust a big thank you for all the people I\'ve chatted to/jammed with/learned from over the years, you\'ve all been a huge inspiration, and I\'m very glad to have been able to share my livecoding journey with you.  \\n\\n<img src=\\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Tkwbk75/0/O/i-Tkwbk75.jpg\\"  width=\\"600\\" height=\\"450\\" />     \\n(photo: Jason Richardson)"},{"id":"/2019/05/30/welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/05/30/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/tree/main/blog/blog/2019-05-30-welcome.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-30-welcome.md","title":"New Documentation","description":"I\'ve started working on a major overhaul / reorganization of the old Tidal Userbase website.
