What have you worked on?**\\n\\nI think I\'ve had a go at just about everything:\\n\\n- I developed and maintain a [Linux installer](https://github.com/cleary/ansible-tidalcycles) in Ansible\\n- I\'ve added a few [simple patches to](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/commits?author=cleary)/nutted out ideas for tidal itself, particularly around the [chords module](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/rfc-working-on-making-chord-naming-chordlist-more-consistent/2717)\\n- I\'ve written [documentation](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/commits?author=cleary)\\n- I often [play in](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjdg8PPpRgsw4w9bSmX5JY7b), and have helped organise some of the Solstice Marathon Livestreams\\n- I am active and support others on the [forums](https://club.tidalcycles.org/u/cleary/summary) and the discord support channels\\n- For the last 2 years I\'ve been hosting a weekly collaborative (mostly tidal) livecoding session called [WeekendJam](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjfCNVBK2O0W0_nwiSgWIoFR) for anyone to come along and have a jam with me\\n- I\'ve written and run tidal-based [workshops](https://decoded.livecode.au), online and [in](https://allevents.in/griffith/decoded-%E2%80%94%E2%80%94-an-artistic-livecoding-workshop/200022125384118) [person](https://infrequency.au/) to try and network/raise the profile of the [livecoding scene in Australia](http://www.ozchi.org/2022/creativity.html)\\n\\n**What motivates you to be a Tidal contributor?**\\n\\n- The community is lovely, they give/have given me a lot and I like to return that where I can. The project allows for such vast and varied possibilities in learning and creation, and that\'s what keeps me interested. The focus on inclusivity, sharing and generally \\"anti-gatekeeping\\" is a huge drawcard for me too.\\n- I particularly enjoy the WeekendJams - I get to meet new people, share inspirations with all the different ideas all mashed together, learn, and just generally have a great time. I\'ve made some great friends through jams.\\n\\n## Livecoding\\n<img src=\\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-7r8LGsw/0/O/i-7r8LGsw.jpg\\"  width=\\"600\\" height=\\"450\\" />   \\n(photo: Jason Richardson)\\n\\n**What do you like about livecoding in Tidal?**\\n\\n- It\'s concise, it\'s (fairly) self-explanatory, and it\'s very easy to be both creatively specific and random as required.\\n\\n**How do you approach your livecoding sessions?**\\n\\n- For solo performances, I prepare something - usually a \\"scaffolded\\" set of code which allows for creative path choosing during the set.\\n- For the WeekendJam sessions, I never prepare anything beyond the occasional group idea for exploration (which is broached 5 mins before start time).\\n\\n**What functions and coding approaches do you like to use?**\\n\\n- I tend to make a point to separate my rhythmic and harmonic elements for easy reuse (`struct` and `n`/`note`) - which is a hangover from the collaborative nature of the WeekendJam sessions. I keep the code for most sets I play on [Github](https://github.com/cleary/livecode/tree/main/sets).\\n\\n**Do you use Tidal with other tools / environments?**\\n\\n- I\'ve done some external software synth control (Vital/Yoshimi), I also have a Midi Fighter Twister controller which sometimes gets a run. I tend to keep it pretty vanilla though, particularly since doing the workshop tours last year. Also, [estuary](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca) of course.\\n\\n## Music\\n**Tell us about your livecoding music. What musical genre(s) or style(s) describe it best?**\\n\\n- Varied? I don\'t really know much about genres - for more musical stuff, I tend to make use of western music theory. If I\'m doing solely rhythmic stuff I tend to try and push myself [outside my common use 4/4 6/8 time signatures](https://youtu.be/to1_4id_oyc) - the few patterns I did for [#patternuary this year](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjdh9SJqIQeku8u9g1acI5Y5) probably highlight that variety fairly well.\\n\\n**How has your music evolved since you have been livecoding?**\\n\\n- Yeah, _a lot_ - I played \\"traditional\\" instruments before I started. The biggest evolution has involved trying to break out of all the subconscious composer lockin that comes with that (fixed tempos, chords limited by number of fingers/how far they can stretch, increasing the number of simultaneous voices). It\'s moved from what I could do on a guitar/bass/piano with 10 fingers and a looper to beyond orchestral possibilities (and exposed my lack of compositional knowledge in that area!).\\n\\n**What samples or instruments do you like to work with?**\\n\\n- Anything :) I\'ve been trying to get more comfortable [working with break samples](https://youtu.be/JsZPN3yqu2s) a bit lately.\\n\\n**What projects are you currently working on / planning? What\'s next?**\\n\\n- I\'d like to develop the livecode.au domain into a tool for organisation/promotion of Australian livecoding events/personalities, that one is going to take more time than I currently have available, so it\'s on the backburner for now (unless anyone wants to give me hand!)\\n- To try and claw back a little time, I\'m looking at sharing the WeekendJam load a little, and hopefully moving it into a general stream/yt account so that multiple organisers can have control depending on availability.\\n- I\'d also like to finish and release some music, just to learn a bit more about the whole process chain - that\'s a hope item for this year :)\\n\\n## Links to your music / recorded livecoding sessions:\\n\\n- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@clearyss\\n- Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/bergra\\n- Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/clearyss\\n- Github (code): https://github.com/cleary/livecode\\n\\n## Other\\n\\nJust a big thank you for all the people I\'ve chatted to/jammed with/learned from over the years, you\'ve all been a huge inspiration, and I\'m very glad to have been able to share my livecoding journey with you.  \\n\\n<img src=\\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Tkwbk75/0/O/i-Tkwbk75.jpg\\"  width=\\"600\\" height=\\"450\\" />     \\n(photo: Jason Richardson)"},{"id":"/tidal_profile_tedthetrumpet","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tidal_profile_tedthetrumpet","editUrl":"https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/tree/main/blog/blog/tidal_profile_tedthetrumpet.md","source":"@site/blog/tidal_profile_tedthetrumpet.md","title":"Tidal Profile - tedthetrumpet (J Simon van der Walt)","description":"| Tidal Cyclist  | J Simon van der Walt |","date":"2023-02-25T15:33:48.000Z","formattedDate":"February 25, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":3.73,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Tidal Profile - tedthetrumpet (J Simon van der Walt)"},"prevItem":{"title":"Tidal Profile - cleary (Bernard Gray)","permalink":"/blog/contributor_profile_cleary"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Documentation","permalink":"/blog/2019/05/30/welcome"}},"content":"| Tidal Cyclist  | J Simon van der Walt |\\n| --------:    | :---------- |\\n| aka    | tedthetrumpet |\\n| Time with Tidal | 3  yrs |\\n| Other LiveCoding env | SuperCollider, Hydra, Strudel, Punctual |\\n| Music available online | [Bandcamp](https://tedthetrumpet.bandcamp.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/tedthetrumpet)  |\\n| Other music/audio sw | Audacity, MuseScore, Logic |\\n\\n<img\\n  src={require(\'./jsvdw-birdhide.jpg\').default}\\n  alt=\\"ttt birding\\"\\n  width=\\"600\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Livecoding\\n\\n**What do you like about livecoding in Tidal?**\\n\\n- I have no background in computer science, but I find the syntax suprisingly intuitive. Also, by comparison with SuperCollider, you can get a lot of music going with very little typing.\\n\\n**How do you approach your livecoding sessions?**\\n\\n- Two main approaches, I guess. Usually it\'s just [quick improvisations](https://diode.zone/w/ocNZjYtoL54a1rcymwH2Gg) on the spur of the moment, often ending up with nothing more than a one minute long sketch. I\'m not particularly trying to create anything specific, and I just stop when I have something that sounds interesting.\\n- The other approach is when I have an idea for a particular sound or gesture or structure that I want to create. This is usually less succesful: I\'ve got a lot of [abandoned projects](https://youtu.be/zQwASJEnYEY) where I tried and failed over a period of days or weeks to achieve some aim or other.\\n\\n**What functions and coding approaches do you like to use?**\\n\\n- My favourite technique is one that some people frown on: making random but fixed patterns that repeat themselves. So, for instance, rather than explicitly creating a pattern in the mini notation, I usually start with something like `d1 $ n (loopFirst $ shuffle 8 $ run 8) # s \\"peri\\"`. (Which is actually one place where SuperCollider wins in conciseness, it\'s basically [Pshuf](http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Pshuf.html)).\\n\\n\\n## Music\\n**Tell us about your livecoding music. What musical genre(s) or style(s) describe it best?**\\n\\n- Three main approaches: er\u2026 [gamelan](https://youtu.be/yN1STGvmRqY), [algorave](https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/twaytee), and [abstract](https://youtu.be/ID4Zh3C2Oso)? I should say \'gamelan\': in other words music that may use gamelan samples and ideas from Javanese or Balinese music without *really* being gamelan music. I have no proper skills, knowledge or understanding when it comes to dance music, but it\'s always fun to try to improvise an algorave banger live. \'Abstract\' might be when I use something like `slowstripe` to defeat any sense of pulse and start pitching samples down a couple of octaves.\\n\\n**How has your music evolved since you have been livecoding?**\\n\\n- I could say that livecoding saved my musical creativity after I finished my [PhD](https://archive.org/details/TheOtherOtherHand)! I got kind of burned out after spending seven years creating a conventional portfolio of \'compositions\'. With code I was able to just make stuff for myself without having to score it or get other people to play it or justify it to anyone.\\n\\n**What samples or instruments do you like to work with?**\\n\\n- My own samples. For me, creating and using my [own](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/samples/tptm) [sets](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/samples/longwhistles) of sounds is kind of fundamental to the creative process. For the purposes of a quick rave-up I\'ll happily turn to the standard Tidal set, but for me to really feel ownership of a piece I need to use samples and synths that I have a personal stake in.\\n\\n**What projects are you currently working on / planning? What\'s next?**\\n\\n- I need to find a way to release my [actual first album](https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/thealbumteaser). I finished it several years ago, but the label who were going to release it stopped functioning, so\u2026 I don\'t feel like I want to release it myself but I haven\'t found anyone else who is interested. Yet.\\n\\n\\n## Tidal Contributions\\n**How do you contribute to Tidal Cycles? What have you worked on?**\\n\\n- I\'m a musician not a developer, so I\'m not really able to \'contribute\' in the sense of code! However, I have made some [gamelan sample banks](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/nmsamples) available, asked (hopefully useful) questions on forums, taught Tidal at [my institution](https://pure.rcs.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/j-simon-van-der-walt(449d6ab3-50fe-4a02-bc83-76e1f88b2769).html), and initiated the [Floating Gold](http://www.nagamas.co.uk/floatinggold/) project that used MiniTidal in [Estuary](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary).\\n\\n## Links to your music / recorded livecoding sessions:\\n\\n- Most of the things I\'ve put out are actually in SuperCollider, but these are Tidal/MiniTidal \u2013\\n    - Improvising \'gamelan\' music in Estuary https://diode.zone/w/ppenMJ4p9W2b41pDe7ZNiA\\n    - Short Estuary piece \'brarnarnarnarnard\' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV4G1z55ePA\\n    - Solstice Night Stream Dec 2022 - Livecoding with Audacity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YpgHdJY-Kw&list=PLMBIpibV-wQIdS6D1vdijRZPfLBrRP9A_&index=6\\n    - Part of a longer jam I\'d forgotten about, starts abstract and gets a bit more rave later  https://youtu.be/jDl_ALEq4Zs?t=575\\n\\n## Other\\n\\n<img\\n  src={require(\'./jspcanscrop.png\').default}\\n  alt=\\"youth photo with vintage synth\\"\\n  width=\\"600\\"\\n/>\\n\\n- With my brother, late 1970s, homebrew [analog synth](http://pcbunn.cithep.caltech.edu/jjb/Synthesizers/Minisonic2/default.htm).\\n- [jsimonvanderwalt.com](https://jsimonvanderwalt.com)\\n- [tedthetrumpet.hotglue.me](https://tedthetrumpet.hotglue.me/)"},{"id":"/2019/05/30/welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/05/30/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/tree/main/blog/blog/2019-05-30-welcome.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-30-welcome.md","title":"New Documentation","description":"I\'ve started working on a major overhaul / reorganization of the old Tidal Userbase website.
