*(General Instructions: The Blog topic template is intended for use with any specific topic. It can be about Tidal features, livecoding, Tidal with external apps, etc. It can also be a more free-form approach to the Blog profile - where you discuss your individual approach to Tidal and livecoding - without following the question/answer format. For an example see Lucy's post on [Working with samples the Heavy Lifting way](https://tidalcycles.org/blog/tidal_profile_heavylifting).)*
