The project allows for such vast and varied possibilities in learning and creation, and that's what keeps me interested. The focus on inclusivity, sharing and generally "anti-gatekeeping" is a huge drawcard for me too.</li><li>I particularly enjoy the WeekendJams - I get to meet new people, share inspirations with all the different ideas all mashed together, learn, and just generally have a great time. I've made some great friends through jams.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="livecoding">Livecoding<a class="hash-link" href="#livecoding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-7r8LGsw/0/O/i-7r8LGsw.jpg" width="600" height="450" class="img_ev3q">(photo: Jason Richardson)<p><strong>What do you like about livecoding in Tidal?</strong></p><ul><li>It's concise, it's (fairly) self-explanatory, and it's very easy to be both creatively specific and random as required.</li></ul><p><strong>How do you approach your livecoding sessions?</strong></p><ul><li>For solo performances, I prepare something - usually a "scaffolded" set of code which allows for creative path choosing during the set.</li><li>For the WeekendJam sessions, I never prepare anything beyond the occasional group idea for exploration (which is broached 5 mins before start time).</li></ul><p><strong>What functions and coding approaches do you like to use?</strong></p><ul><li>I tend to make a point to separate my rhythmic and harmonic elements for easy reuse (<code>struct</code> and <code>n</code>/<code>note</code>) - which is a hangover from the collaborative nature of the WeekendJam sessions. I keep the code for most sets I play on <a href="https://github.com/cleary/livecode/tree/main/sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Do you use Tidal with other tools / environments?</strong></p><ul><li>I've done some external software synth control (Vital/Yoshimi), I also have a Midi Fighter Twister controller which sometimes gets a run. I tend to keep it pretty vanilla though, particularly since doing the workshop tours last year. Also, <a href="https://estuary.mcmaster.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estuary</a> of course.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="music">Music<a class="hash-link" href="#music" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Tell us about your livecoding music. What musical genre(s) or style(s) describe it best?</strong></p><ul><li>Varied? I don't really know much about genres - for more musical stuff, I tend to make use of western music theory. If I'm doing solely rhythmic stuff I tend to try and push myself <a href="https://youtu.be/to1_4id_oyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outside my common use 4/4 6/8 time signatures</a> - the few patterns I did for <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8O3WdGnQjdh9SJqIQeku8u9g1acI5Y5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#patternuary this year</a> probably highlight that variety fairly well.</li></ul><p><strong>How has your music evolved since you have been livecoding?</strong></p><ul><li>Yeah, <em>a lot</em> - I played "traditional" instruments before I started. The biggest evolution has involved trying to break out of all the subconscious composer lockin that comes with that (fixed tempos, chords limited by number of fingers/how far they can stretch, increasing the number of simultaneous voices). It's moved from what I could do on a guitar/bass/piano with 10 fingers and a looper to beyond orchestral possibilities (and exposed my lack of compositional knowledge in that area!).</li></ul><p><strong>What samples or instruments do you like to work with?</strong></p><ul><li>Anything :) I've been trying to get more comfortable <a href="https://youtu.be/JsZPN3yqu2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working with break samples</a> a bit lately.</li></ul><p><strong>What projects are you currently working on / planning? What's next?</strong></p><ul><li>I'd like to develop the livecode.au domain into a tool for organisation/promotion of Australian livecoding events/personalities, that one is going to take more time than I currently have available, so it's on the backburner for now (unless anyone wants to give me hand!)</li><li>To try and claw back a little time, I'm looking at sharing the WeekendJam load a little, and hopefully moving it into a general stream/yt account so that multiple organisers can have control depending on availability.</li><li>I'd also like to finish and release some music, just to learn a bit more about the whole process chain - that's a hope item for this year :)</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="links-to-your-music--recorded-livecoding-sessions">Links to your music / recorded livecoding sessions:<a class="hash-link" href="#links-to-your-music--recorded-livecoding-sessions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@clearyss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/@clearyss</a></li><li>Soundcloud: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bergra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://soundcloud.com/bergra</a></li><li>Twitch: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/clearyss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.twitch.tv/clearyss</a></li><li>Github (code): <a href="https://github.com/cleary/livecode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cleary/livecode</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other">Other<a class="hash-link" href="#other" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Just a big thank you for all the people I've chatted to/jammed with/learned from over the years, you've all been a huge inspiration, and I'm very glad to have been able to share my livecoding journey with you.  </p><img loading="lazy" src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Tkwbk75/0/O/i-Tkwbk75.jpg" width="600" height="450" class="img_ev3q">(photo: Jason Richardson)]]></content>

Also, by comparison with SuperCollider, you can get a lot of music going with very little typing.</li></ul><p><strong>How do you approach your livecoding sessions?</strong></p><ul><li>Two main approaches, I guess. Usually it's just <a href="https://diode.zone/w/ocNZjYtoL54a1rcymwH2Gg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick improvisations</a> on the spur of the moment, often ending up with nothing more than a one minute long sketch. I'm not particularly trying to create anything specific, and I just stop when I have something that sounds interesting.</li><li>The other approach is when I have an idea for a particular sound or gesture or structure that I want to create. This is usually less succesful: I've got a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/zQwASJEnYEY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoned projects</a> where I tried and failed over a period of days or weeks to achieve some aim or other.</li></ul><p><strong>What functions and coding approaches do you like to use?</strong></p><ul><li>My favourite technique is one that some people frown on: making random but fixed patterns that repeat themselves. So, for instance, rather than explicitly creating a pattern in the mini notation, I usually start with something like <code>d1 $ n (loopFirst $ shuffle 8 $ run 8) # s "peri"</code>. (Which is actually one place where SuperCollider wins in conciseness, it's basically <a href="http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Pshuf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pshuf</a>).</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="music">Music<a class="hash-link" href="#music" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Tell us about your livecoding music. What musical genre(s) or style(s) describe it best?</strong></p><ul><li>Three main approaches: er… <a href="https://youtu.be/yN1STGvmRqY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gamelan</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/twaytee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">algorave</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ID4Zh3C2Oso" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abstract</a>? I should say 'gamelan': in other words music that may use gamelan samples and ideas from Javanese or Balinese music without <em>really</em> being gamelan music. I have no proper skills, knowledge or understanding when it comes to dance music, but it's always fun to try to improvise an algorave banger live. 'Abstract' might be when I use something like <code>slowstripe</code> to defeat any sense of pulse and start pitching samples down a couple of octaves.</li></ul><p><strong>How has your music evolved since you have been livecoding?</strong></p><ul><li>I could say that livecoding saved my musical creativity after I finished my <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheOtherOtherHand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhD</a>! I got kind of burned out after spending seven years creating a conventional portfolio of 'compositions'. With code I was able to just make stuff for myself without having to score it or get other people to play it or justify it to anyone.</li></ul><p><strong>What samples or instruments do you like to work with?</strong></p><ul><li>My own samples. For me, creating and using my <a href="https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/samples/tptm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own</a> <a href="https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/samples/longwhistles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sets</a> of sounds is kind of fundamental to the creative process. For the purposes of a quick rave-up I'll happily turn to the standard Tidal set, but for me to really feel ownership of a piece I need to use samples and synths that I have a personal stake in.</li></ul><p><strong>What projects are you currently working on / planning? What's next?</strong></p><ul><li>I need to find a way to release my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/thealbumteaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual first album</a>. I finished it several years ago, but the label who were going to release it stopped functioning, so… I don't feel like I want to release it myself but I haven't found anyone else who is interested.
