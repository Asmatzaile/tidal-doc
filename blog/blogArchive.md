  - Malitzin Cortes aka CNDSD
  - Kindohm aka Mike Hodnick
- [Summer of Haskell Project](https://blog.tidalcycles.org/category/interviews/index.html)
- [Six Months of Tidal](https://blog.tidalcycles.org/index.html%3Fp=346.html)

Some of the posts are a bit dated, and refer to older versions of Tidal, but it is still interesting to reflect on how things have evolved.
