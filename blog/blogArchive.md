The older site had a Blog feature with posts from 2017 - 2020.  
[TidalCycles Blog Archive](https://blog.tidalcycles.org/index.html)

Content to explore:
- [Interviews](https://blog.tidalcycles.org/category/interviews/index.html)
  - Malitzin Cortes aka CNDSD
  - Kindohm aka Mike Hodnick
- [Autonomous Live Coding: Summer of Haskell Project](https://blog.tidalcycles.org/index.html%3Fp=1280.html)
- [Six Months of Tidal](https://blog.tidalcycles.org/index.html%3Fp=346.html)

Some of the posts may be dated, or refer to older versions of Tidal. But it is still interesting to reflect on how things have evolved.
