## Livecoding  

**What do you like about livecoding in Tidal? What inspires you?**   

I find the way Tidal allows me to approach music in a structural way fascinating. I like it's concise but still verbose syntax, especially combined with the mini-syntax.

**How do you approach your livecoding sessions?** 

When I make music on my own, I like to start out with simple rhythmic patterns and start to layer them with different versions of themselves (slower & lower / faster & higher / ..). Now apply the MI clouds effect and you can have fun for hours adjusting the parameters! 

I also like to use a traditional game controller and map the controls to conditional functions or effects in the code. For example, playing a drum pattern twice as fast when I press the 'A' button, or adjust the pan according to a joystick. I like the thought that I am programming the functionality of a game live, while I am also playing it.

**What functions and coding approaches do you like to use?**  

Probably my most used Tidal functions are `layer` and `while`. I also use the control bus feature a lot to manipulate the FX of longer sounds. I also really like how randomness in Tidal works and how easy it is no generate arbitrary, but repeating sequences or rhythms.

**Do you use Tidal with other tools / environments?**

I like to use Tidal together with Hydra and Vimix and like to use a game controller for external hardware.

## Tidal Contributions  

**How do you contribute to Tidal Cycles? What have you worked on?**  

* I had the opportunity to work on Tidal as part of the Haskell Summer of Code 2021. There, I mainly worked on packaging Tidal to allow users to use it without an installation of the whole Haskell environment. This led to me developing a whole code [editor/interpeter](https://github.com/polymorphicengine/tidal-gui) with some features especially designed for Tidal, like the display of which patterns are playing/muted, the current cps/bpm and the ability to control all features of the editor via OSC.

* I'm also working on the [tidal-listener](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/tree/main/tidal-listener) which also provides a standalone intrepreter that editor plugins etc. can use as an alternative to ghci.

* Now I am mostly working on things that are related to the mini-notation and how it is parsed and interpreted. Most notably, I found a way to make the chord notation patternable and made it easier to add new custom chord modifiers.

**What motivates you to work on Tidal?**   

Curiosity of the inner workings of Tidal and the great community!

## Music  

**Tell us about your livecoding music.**  

* I often improvise together with people who play more traditional instruments. I find it very interesting to use microphones to get what the others are playing as an input that I can manipulate through coding. 
* I'm also interested in multi-channel sound / acousmatic music and the possibilities of live-coding in this context.

**What samples or instruments do you like to work with?**  

Recently, I like to use very tiny grains of samples and process them with Tidal. What I like about this approach is that it is easy to manipulate and add effects to each grain individually. I also like to record my own samples with various microphones.

**What projects are you currently working on or planning? What's next?**  

* I would like to work on a bigger scale AV performance using Tidal, Hydra and Vimix altogether, to create something like a short film.
* I'm also working on an interactive sound installation where I will probably use Tidal to generate the sound.
* I'm working on a new acousmatic piece for a composition competition.

### Other  

I'm currently working on a live-coding language that will extend the mini-notation to a full programming language. It is still in early development, but maybe somebody is interested in helping me out! I'm working on it [here](https://github.com/polymorphicengine/minilambda/tree/types).
