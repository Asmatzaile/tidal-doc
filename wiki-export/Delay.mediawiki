[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>delay :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''delay''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that changes the level of the initial delay signal.
A value of <code>1</code> means the first echo will be as loud as the original sound.

<source>
d1 $ s "[drum cp]*2 jvbass" # delay "[0 0.5]/2" # orbit 1
</source>

As delay is a global effect, you will want to use it in tandem with [[orbit]] (unless you're only running one pattern at a time).
