[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>stut :: Pattern Integer -> Pattern Double -> Pattern Rational -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern</source>

'''stut''' applies a type of delay to a pattern. It has three parameters, which could be called depth, feedback and time. Depth is an integer and the others floating point. This adds a bit of echo:

<source>
d1 $ stut 4 0.5 0.1 $ sound "bd sn"
</source>

The above results in <source inline>4</source> repeats (the original plus 3 echoes), each echo 50% (that's the <source inline>0.5</source>) quieter than the last, separated by 1/10th (that's the <source inline>0.1</source>) of a cycle. 

It is possible to reverse the echo:

<source>
d1 $ stut 4 0.5 (-0.1) $ sound "bd sn"
</source>

= stutWith =

[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>stutWith :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''stutWith''' (formerly known as <source inline>stut'</source>) is similar to <source inline>stut</source> described above, but instead of just decreasing volume to produce echoes, stutWith applies a function each step and overlays the result delayed by the given time.

<source>
d1 $ stutWith 3 (1/3) (# vowel "{a e i o u}%2") $ sound "bd sn"
</source>

In this case there are two overlays delayed by 1/3 of a cycle, where each has the vowel filter applied.

<source>
d1 $ stutWith 4 (1/6) (|* speed "1.5") $ sound "arpy arpy:2"
</source>

In the above, three versions are put on top, with each step getting higher in pitch as <source inline>|* speed "1.5"</source> is successively applied.
