[[Type]]: <source inline>Pattern Int -> Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern</source>

'''slice''' is similar to [[chop]] and [[striate]], in that it's used to slice samples up into bits. The difference is that it allows you to rearrange those bits as a pattern.

<source>
d1 $ slice 8 "7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0" $ sound "breaks165"
  # legato 1
</source>

The above slices the sample into eight bits, and then plays them backwards, equivalent of applying <source inline>rev $ chop 8</source>. Here's a more complex example:

<source>
d1 $ slice 8 "[<0*8 0*2> 3*4 2 4] [4 .. 7]" $ sound "breaks165"
  # legato 1
</source>

See also [[bite]], which is similar but slices up patterns, rather than samples.

''Note that the order of the first two parameters changed since tidal version 1.0.0''

== splice ==

[[Type]]: <source inline>splice :: Int -> Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern</source>

'''splice''' is similar to <source inline>slice</source>, but the slices are automatically pitched up or down to fit their 'slot'.

<source>
d1 $ splice 8 "[<0*8 0*2> 3*4 2 4] [4 .. 7]" $ sound "breaks165"
</source>
