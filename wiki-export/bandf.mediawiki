[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>bandf :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''bandf''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that sets the center frequency of a band pass filter.
In SuperDirt, this is in Hz (try a range between 0 and 10000). In classic dirt, it is from 0 to 1.

You can use [[bpf]] as a shortcut for '''bandf'''.
