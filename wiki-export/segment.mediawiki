{{DISPLAYTITLE:segment}} 
[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>segment :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''segment''' 'samples' the pattern at a rate of n events per cycle.  Useful for turning a continuous pattern into a discrete one.

In this example, the pattern originates from the shape of a sine wave, a continuous pattern.  Without <source inline>segment</source> the samples will get triggered at an undefined frequency which may be very high.

= discretise =

<source inline>segment</source> used to be known as <source inline>discretise</source>. The old name remains as an alias and will still work, but may be removed or repurposed in a future version of tidal.
