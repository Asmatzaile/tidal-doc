{{DISPLAYTITLE:zoom}} 
[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>zoom :: (Time, Time) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

Plays a portion of a pattern, specified by the beginning and end of a time span (known as an 'arc'). The new resulting pattern is played over the time period of the original pattern:

<source>
d1 $ zoom (0.25, 0.75) $ sound "bd*2 hh*3 [sn bd]*2 drum"
</source>

In the pattern above, zoom is used with an arc from 25% to 75%. It is equivalent to this pattern:

<source>
d1 $ sound "hh*3 [sn bd]*2"
</source>

Hereâ€™s an example of it being used with a conditional:

<source>
d1 $ every 4 (zoom (0.25, 0.75)) $ sound "bd*2 hh*3 [sn bd]*2 drum"
</source>
