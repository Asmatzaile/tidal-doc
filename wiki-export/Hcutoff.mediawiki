[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>hcutoff :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''hcutoff''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that sets the cutoff frequency of a high pass filter.
In SuperDirt, this is in Hz (try a range between 0 and 10000). In classic dirt, it is from 0 to 1.

[[hpf]] is a shortcut for '''hcutoff'''.
