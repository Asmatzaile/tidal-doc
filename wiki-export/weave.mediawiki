[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>weave :: Time -> ControlPattern -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</source>

'''weave''' applies one control pattern to a list of other control patterns, with a successive time offset. For example:

<source>
d1 $ weave 16 (pan sine)
  [sound "bd sn cp",
   sound "casio casio:1",
   sound "[jvbass*2 jvbass:2]/2",
   sound "hc*4"
  ]
</source>

In the above, the <source inline>pan sine</source> control pattern is slowed down by the given number of cycles, in particular <source inline>16</source>, and applied to all of the given <source inline>sound</source> patterns. What makes this interesting is that the <source inline>pan</source> control pattern is successively offset for each of the given sound patterns; because the pan is closed down by 16 cycles, and there are four patterns, they are 'spread out', i.e. with a gap of four cycles. For this reason, the four patterns seem to chase after each other around the stereo field. Try listening on headphones to hear this more clearly.

You can even have it the other way round, and have the effect parameters chasing after each other around a sound parameter, like this:

<source>
d1 $ weave 16 (sound "arpy" >| n (run 8))
  [vowel "a e i",
   vowel "i [i o] o u",
   vowel "[e o]/3 [i o u]/2",
   speed "1 2 3"
  ]
</source>

= weaveWith =
[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>weaveWith :: Time -> Pattern a -> [Pattern a -> Pattern a] -> Pattern a</source>

<source inline>weaveWith</source> (formerly known as <source inline>weave'</source>) is similar to the above, but weaves with a list of functions, rather than a list of controls. For example:

<source>
d1 $ weaveWith 3 (sound "bd [sn drum:2*2] bd*2 [sn drum:1]")
  [fast 2, 
   (# speed "0.5"),
   chop 16
  ]
</source>
