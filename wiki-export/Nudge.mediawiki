[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>nudge :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''nudge''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that changes the timing of a sample. Allows for nice things like swing feeling:

<source>
d1 $ stack [
  sound "bd bd/4",
  sound "hh(5,8)"
  ] # nudge "[0 0.04]*4"
</source>

Low values will give a more human feeling, high values might result in quite the contrary.

You can also use <code>nudge</code> to create continuous time stretches (although this might be better to do with [[cps]]):

<source>
d1 $ s "drum*8" # nudge (range 0 1 $ slow 8 sine)
</source>

You can also use <code>nudge</code> to fine-tune timing with other processes.
