[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>foldEvery :: [Int] -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''foldEvery''' transforms a pattern with a function, once per any of the given number of cycles. If a particular cycle is the start of more than one of the given cycle periods, then it it applied more than once. It is similar to chaining multiple [[every]] functions together.

Example:

<source>
d1 $ foldEvery [3, 4, 5] (fast 2) $ sound "bd sn kurt"
</source>

this is equal to:

<source>
d1 $ every 3 (fast 2) $ every 4 (fast 2) $ every 5 (fast 2) $ sound "bd sn kurt"
</source>
