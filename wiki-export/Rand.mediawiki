[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>rand :: Fractional a => Pattern a </syntaxhighlight>

'''rand''' is an [[Oscillators|oscillator]] that generates a pattern of (pseudo-)random, floating point numbers between 0 and 1.  For example to randomly pan around the stereo field you can:

<source>
d1 $ sound "bd*8" # pan rand
</source>

Or to enjoy a randomised '''speed''' from 0.5 to 1.5, you can add 0.5 to it.

<source>
d1 $ sound "arpy*4" # speed (rand + 0.5)
</source>

[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>irand :: Num a => Int -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

'''irand''' is similar to [[rand]], but generates a [[Oscillators|continuous oscillator]] of (pseudo-)random integers between 0 to n-1 inclusive.  Notably used to pick random samples from a folder.

<source>
d1 $ sound "amencutup*8" # n (irand 8)
</source>
