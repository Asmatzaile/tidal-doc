{{DISPLAYTITLE:n}} 
[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>n :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern</source>

'''n''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that changes the sample being played in the specified sound folder on disk. 
The default value is '''0''', which plays the first sample in the sound folder. A value of '''1''' plays the next sample in the folder,
a value of '''2''' plays the next, and so on:

<source>
d1 $ s "drum*4" # n "0"
d1 $ s "drum*4" # n "1"
d1 $ s "drum*4" # n "2 3"
d1 $ s "drum*4" # n "0 1 2 3"
</source>

A shorthand version of '''n''' is to use a colon followed by a number after a sound name:

<source>
d1 $ s "drum:0"
d1 $ s "drum:1"
d1 $ s "drum:0 drum:3 drum:2 drum:1*2"
</source>

You can of course combine sound patterns with patterns of '''n''' to easily create patterns with more complexity:

<source>
d1 $ s "drum [cp hh] odx*2 arpy*2" # n "[1 3 5 0 2]/2"
</source>

'''n''' is an index that starts at zero, so to play the 5th sample in a folder, you would use the number 4:

<source>d1 $ s "drum" # n "4"</source>
