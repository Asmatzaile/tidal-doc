[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>hurry :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

'''hurry''' is similiar to [[fast]], in that it speeds up a pattern, but it also increases the [[speed]] control by the same factor, so if you're triggering samples, the sound gets higher in pitch. For example:

<source>
d1 $ every 2 (hurry 2) $ sound "bd sn:2 ~ cp"
</source>
