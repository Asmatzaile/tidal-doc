[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>swingBy :: Pattern Time -> Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

The function <source inline>swingBy x n</source> breaks each cycle into <source inline>n</source> slices, and then delays events in the second half of each slice by the amount <source inline>x</source>, which is relative to the size of the (half) slice. So if <source inline>x</source> is 0 it does nothing, <source inline>0.5</source> delays for half the note duration, and <source inline>1</source> will wrap around to doing nothing again. The end result is a shuffle or swing-like rhythm. For example:

<source>
d1 $ swingBy (1/3) 4 $ sound "hh*8"
</source>

will delay every other "hh" 1/3 of the way to the next "hh".
