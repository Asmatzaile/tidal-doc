[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>end :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''end''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that changes the playback end position of a sample.

'''end''' takes a pattern of numbers from 0 to 1. It controls the end point of each sample. 
e.g. 0.75 to only play 75% of each sample, 0.5 to only play 50%, and so on:

<source>
d1 $ s "rave/2" # end "<0 0.25 0.5>"
</source>

You can use [[begin]] to alter the playback start position of a sample.
