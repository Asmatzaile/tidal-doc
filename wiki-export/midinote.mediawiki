[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>midinote :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''midinote''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that specifies the note on a MIDI keyboard to play, beginning at zero.
This is different from [[note]], which instead normalizes zero to Middle C. '''midinote''' only works when using SuperDirt MIDI patterns.

To play a low A0, which is MIDI note 21:

<source>
d1 $ s "midi" # midinote "21"
</source>

To play a C4, or "middle C":

<source>
d1 $ s "midi" # midinote "60"
</source>

'''midinote''' is very similar to [[note]]. The difference is that '''midinote''' is not normalized to Middle C. <code>midinote "0"</code> plays the absolute lowest note 
in MIDI, and <code>note "0"</code> plays Middle C.
