[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>lpf :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''lpf''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that sets the cutoff frequency of a low pass filter.
In SuperDirt, this is in Hz (try a range between 0 and 10000). In classic dirt, it is from 0 to 1.

'''lpf''' is a shortcut for [[cutoff]].
