[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>randcat :: [Pattern a] -> Pattern a</source>

'''randcat''' is similar to [[cat]], but rather than playing the given patterns in order, it picks them at random. For example:

<source>
d1 $ randcat [sound "bd*2 sn", sound "jvbass*3", sound "drum*2", sound "ht mt"]
</source>
