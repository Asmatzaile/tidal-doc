[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>fast :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

'''fast''' speeds up a pattern. For example, the following will play the sound pattern "bd sn kurt" twice as fast (i.e. so it repeats twice per cycle), and the vowel pattern three times as fast:

<source>
d1 $ sound (fast 2 "bd sn kurt")
   # fast 3 (vowel "a e o")
</source>

The first parameter can be patterned, for example to play the pattern at twice the speed for the first half of each cycle and then four times the speed for the second half:

<source>
d1 $ fast "2 4" $ sound "bd sn kurt cp"
</source>


You can also use this function by its older alias, <source inline>density</source>.
