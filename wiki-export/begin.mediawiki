[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>begin :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''begin''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that changes the start position of a sample.

'''begin''' takes a pattern of numbers from 0 to 1. It skips the beginning of each sample, 
e.g. 0.25 to cut off the first quarter from each sample, 0.5 to cut off the first half, and so on:

<source>
d1 $ s "rave/2" # begin "<0 0.25 0.5>"
</source>

You can use [[end]] to alter the playback end position of a sample.
