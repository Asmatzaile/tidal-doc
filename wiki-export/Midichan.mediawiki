[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>midichan :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''midichan''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that controls what MIDI channel to play a MIDI pattern on.

'''midichan''' is indexed at zero, which means a value of "0" will play on MIDI channel 1, a value of "1" will play on MIDI channel 2, and so on.

d1 $ note "0 3 7 9" # s "midi" # midichan "5"

Observe that you can make a pattern to play on multiple MIDI channels:

<source>
d1 $ note "0 3 7 9" # s "midi" # midichan "5 1 0 3"
</source>
