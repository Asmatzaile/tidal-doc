[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>stripe :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

The '''stripe''' function repeats a pattern at random speeds. The first parameter gives the number of cycles to operate over, for example <source inline>stripe 2</source> will repeat a pattern twice, over two cycles. Each cycle will be played at a random speed, but in such a way that the total duration will be the same. 

For example in the following example, the start of every third repetition of the <source inline>d1</source> pattern will match with the clap on the <source inline>d2</source> pattern.

<source>
d1 $ stripe 3 $ sound "bd sd ~ [mt ht]"

d2 $ sound "cp"
</source>

= slowstripe =

[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>slowstripe :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

The '''slowstripe''' function is the same as '''stripe''' but the result is also
slowed down by n time (where n is the first parameter of the function. This means that the mean average duration of the stripes
is exactly one cycle, and every nth stripe starts on a cycle
boundary (in indian classical terms, the ''sam'').

usage:

<source>
d1 $ slowstripe 3 $ sound "bd sd ~ [mt ht]"

d2 $ sound "cp"
</source>
