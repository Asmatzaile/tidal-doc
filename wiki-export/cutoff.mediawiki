[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>cutoff :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''cutoff''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that sets the cutoff frequency of a low pass filter.
In SuperDirt, this is in Hz (try a range between 0 and 10000). In classic dirt, it is from 0 to 1.

A shortcut for '''cutoff''' is [[lpf]].
