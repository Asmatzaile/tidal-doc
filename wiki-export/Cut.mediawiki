[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>cut :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern</source>

In the style of classic drum-machines, '''cut''' will stop a playing sample as soon as another sample with the same cutgroup is played.

An example would be an open hi-hat followed by a closed one, and stopping the open hi-hat from playing when a closed one starts:

<source>
d1 $ stack [
  sound "bd",
  sound "~ [~ [ho:2 hc/2]]" # cut "1"
  ]
</source>

This will mute the open hi-hat every second cycle when the closed one is played.

Using <code>cut</code> with negative values will only cut the same sample. This is useful to cut very long samples.

<source>
d1 $ sound "[bev, [ho:3](3,8)]" # cut "-1"
</source>

Using <code>cut "0"</code> is effectively ''no'' cutgroup.

You can also specify a pattern of cutgroups to mute a sample at different times:

<source>
d1 $ sound "bev(3,8)" # cut "[1 2 3]*2"
</source>
