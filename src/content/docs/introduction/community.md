## Getting Help

The main place to get help is the [Tidal Club](https://club.tidalcycles.org/) forum, for example the [Installation help](https://club.tidalcycles.org/c/installation/5) and [Questions and Answers](https://club.tidalcycles.org/c/q-and-a/9) sections.
You can [search the forum](https://club.tidalcycles.org/search) to see if someone had the same problem or question as you before, or post a new topic (requires [free signup](https://club.tidalcycles.org/signup)).


## Discussion and sharing

For live chat and troubleshooting, you can find other Tidal Cyclists and live-coders on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CqWhZEfNbq).

If you wish to report an issue or to be involved in the development process:
