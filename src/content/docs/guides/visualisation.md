`Tidal-vis` is a tool made by Alex McLean to visualize Tidal patterns. This package allows several things:
* OSC messages sent to SuperCollider to be dynamically rendered in realtime with a separate window. Demo of realtime visualisation.
* Colour patterns to be rendered as PDF or SVG files. See *Examples.hs* in the [GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-vis) for more help.
* Colour patterns to be rendered to be rendered dynamicly in separate window. See
  *CycleAnimation.hs* for more. Demo.

## Setup `tidal-vis`

1. Comment out any existing lines in `BootTidal.hs` that begin with `tidal <- startTidal`.

2. Add the following lines to `BootTidal.hs`:

```haskell
 -- Target and shape for pattern visualizing.
 patternTarget = Target { oName = "Pattern handler", oAddress = "127.0.0.1", oPort = 5050, oBusPort = Nothing, oLatency = 0.02, oWindow = Nothing, oSchedule = Pre BundleStamp, oHandshake = False }
 patternShape = OSC "/trigger/something" $ Named {requiredArgs = []}

 -- Target for playing music via SuperCollider.
 musicTarget = superdirtTarget { oLatency = 0.1, oAddress = "127.0.0.1", oPort = 57120 }

 config = defaultConfig {cFrameTimespan = 1/20}

 -- Send pattern as OSC both to SuperCollider and to tidal-vis.
 tidal <- startStream config [(musicTarget, [superdirtShape]), (patternTarget, [patternShape])]

 -- Send pattern as OSC to SuperCollider only.
 -- tidal <- startTidal musicTarget config
```

3. Install `tidal-vis` and run:

```bash
 cabal update
 cabal install tidal-vis
 tidal-vis
```

4. Eval your Tidal code.
