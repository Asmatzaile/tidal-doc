### Purpose of different docs sections

1. **Introduction:** what is Tidal, what is it used for, what has it been used for, who are the community, etc.
2. **Getting started:** how to get up and running from scratch, to making a first sound.
3. **Guides:** all guides to do a specific thing that isn't necessary to know at first.
4. **Reference:** lists of, e.g., functions or options and their descriptions, perhaps with an example; could perhaps be autogenerated.

- **Introduction**
  - What is Tidal? [what it is; what it is used for]
  - The concepts [the components of the stack; cycles and patterns [TODO: identify topics]]
  - Showcase [select performances / releases; list of artists; academic publications; ...]
  - Community [links to platforms, forum]
  - Related projects [livecoding projects, inspired / inspired by; e.g., tidal-vis ...]
- **Getting started**
  - Installation
  - First steps [getting from installed to first sounds, then to sounding like something (introduce to basic usage of stuff, incl. mini-notation) (can be multiple pages) [TODO: decide structure and contents of tutorial]]
- **Guides** [how to do specific things that aren't necessary to know at first; address common questions like "how do I get Tidal to do X?"; page titles should follow from "How to ..." / start with a verb; can perhaps be organised into subsections, or we can rely on search; the below are examples; [TODO: identify all necessary guides]]
  - Manage audio channels
  - Set up network collaboration
  - Fix latency issues
  - Connect MIDI devices
  - Visualise events
  - etc.
- **Explanation** [more in-depth theoretical explanation of internals; Haskell stuff [TODO: identify topics]]
  - ...
- **Reference**
  - Tidal functions [technical documentation, lists of functions]
    - Tempo
    - Time
    - etc.
  - Configuration
    - Tidal
    - SuperDirt
  - Mini-notation


## TODO

- Pages from old site not added yet:
  - ? troubleshooting pages (combine into install page?)
  - tutorials: workshop and course I & II
  - ? trigger a pattern from the start (move to guides)
- blog
  - RSS feed
  - blog front page
    - excerpts / summaries instead of full pages
    - blog info page
- docs content
  - getting started
    - remove single page tutorial
    - structure "basics" pages into being a "tutorial" (and move into getting started section) --- incl. simplify files, e.g., combining related ones; start with (i.e., title the file) the concept being learned and not what is being done in order to learn the concept / skill
  - combine `/reference/sampling-functions` 1 and 2
  - move `/guides/superdirt-config` into `/reference/synthesizers` (or vice versa)
  - move `/guides/tidal-config` into multi-user, latency, `/reference/boot-file`?
  - function names in reference pages in backticks
  - general language editing & content checking
  - translations
  - emphasise strudel more
- design
  - front page design
  - bios/profiles/info box and tables format
  - add section header `#` anchors and click-to-copy url
- general
  - make sure all absolute links to documentation i.e. `tidalcycles.org` links work
  - grep for TODOs in comments
  - check issues and PRs
