### Purpose of different docs sections

1. **Introduction:** what is Tidal, what is it used for, what has it been used for, who are the community, etc.
2. **Getting started:** how to get up and running from scratch, to making a first sound.
3. **Guides:** all guides to do a specific thing that isn't necessary to know at first.
4. **Reference:** lists of, e.g., functions or options and their descriptions, perhaps with an example; could perhaps be autogenerated.

- **Introduction**
  - What is Tidal? [what it is; what it is used for]
  - The concepts [the components of the stack; cycles and patterns [TODO: identify topics]]
  - Showcase [select performances / releases; list of artists; academic publications; ...]
  - Community [links to platforms, forum]
  - Related projects [livecoding projects, inspired / inspired by; e.g., tidal-vis ...]
- **Getting started**
  - Installation
  - First steps [getting from installed to first sounds, then to sounding like something (introduce to basic usage of stuff, incl. mini-notation) (can be multiple pages) [TODO: decide structure and contents of tutorial]]
- **Guides** [how to do specific things that aren't necessary to know at first; address common questions like "how do I get Tidal to do X?"; page titles should follow from "How to ..." / start with a verb; can perhaps be organised into subsections, or we can rely on search; the below are examples; [TODO: identify all necessary guides]]
  - Manage audio channels
  - Set up network collaboration
  - Fix latency issues
  - Connect MIDI devices
  - Visualise events
  - etc.
- **Explanation** [more in-depth theoretical explanation of internals; Haskell stuff [TODO: identify topics]; these suggestions by ninioArtillero on Discord]
  - Haskell syntax for Tidal [use of `$`, `#`, and `.`; left and right associativity, layout rules]
  - The Pattern data type
  - Types and typeclasses [crash course]
  - FRP and pattern semantics
  - The SuperDirt OSC interface
- **Reference**
  - Tidal functions [technical documentation, lists of functions; autogenerate?]
    - Tempo
    - Time
    - etc.
  - Configuration
    - Tidal
    - SuperDirt
  - Mini-notation
